## Hi there!!


##### I am Divya. I am an aspiring Data Analyst. Dive into this repository housing my diverse data analysis projects. I am passionate about data and business. This repository showcases my command over R, SQL, Tableau, & Excel and their combined approach while unraveling trends and patterns across various business domains.

##### This repository contains two different projects.
##### Project 1 is a case study in R where I have analyzed sales of a supermarket to understand trends in different cities. I have tried to uncover trends based on geography, months, and product categories. I have also visualized the analytical findings using the ggplot package.
##### Please visit https://drive.google.com/file/d/113VTcBsRr6m4ONAKgLgduQcbEsMfplpv/view?usp=sharing to view the plots related to the Supermarket_sales_analysis project.
##### It is added separately due to the large file size of the document. 



#### Project 2 is a case study analyzing sales data of Walmart for three cities in Myanmar. Similarly to the previous project, I have tried to understand sales trends for Walmart here. To add a visual touch I have visualized my findings using Tableau and created a dashboard for the same.
#### Please visit https://public.tableau.com/views/WalmartSalesVisualisation-Myanmar/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link to check out this interactive viz. You can apply filters for cities, product categories and customer type.
